title: Italian classes in San Diego

---

My wife Maura D'Andrea is Principal and Teacher of [Italian school of San Diego](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/about/).

All instructors are mother-tongue Italian, they teach to kids and adults.

See the [available Italian in-person classes in San Diego](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/classes), they are split in 2 tracks, one for people looking to learn Italian, one for kids that have Italian heritage and want to follow the same program taught in Italy's public school system.

The high school classes are also certified for High School credit both with San Diego Unified and San Dieguito districts for High School credit, see [the Italian classes for teenagers](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/accredited-classes/)

Finally they have an extensive programs of [in-person Italian classes for adults](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/adults/)

Classes are online and in-person in Kearny Mesa, San Diego.

Ciao e grazie!
