title: Italian and chess classes in San Diego

---

My wife Maura D'Andrea is Principal and Teacher of [Italian school of San Diego](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/about/).

They offer an extensive [Adults Italian classes program in-person in San Diego (Kearny Mesa)](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/adults/), including [Italian for Travelers](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/travelers) specifically for tourists travelling to Italy.

They recently launched 2 new interesting programs starting in April 2025:

* [Chess classes in person in San Diego for kids and adults](https://italianschoolsd.com/chess), for all levels
* [Crochet classes in person in San Diego in the morning for adults](https://italianschoolsd.com/crochet)
