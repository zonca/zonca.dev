title: PySM 3.4.1 Released
---

PySM version 3.4.1 is now available. It can be downloaded from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pysm3/). The [release notes](https://github.com/galsci/pysm/blob/main/CHANGES.rst) detail new features and improvements.

Two new models, *rg2* and *rg3*, have been added:
- **rg2**: Websky radio galaxy model applying a beam on the fly to brightest sources.
- **rg3**: Pre-computed background sources for radio galaxies using catalog data.

Additionally, see [these docs](https://pysm3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preprocess-templates/catalog/compare_catalog_to_original_websky.html) for a comparison of the old *rg1* model with these new models, including plots.
