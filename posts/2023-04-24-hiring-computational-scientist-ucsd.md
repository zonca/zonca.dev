title: Hiring a Computational Scientist at the San Diego Supercomputer Center

---

* Early Career Scientist? Likes Supercomputers? Likes the Sun?

Come work in my group of High Performance Computing "consultants" at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, help scientists develop, scale and run Data Intensive computations on our Supercomputers.

See the job ad below:

> The Scientific Computing Applications group at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, led by Andrea Zonca, is hiring a Computational Scientist with a permanent contract funded by grants.
The ideal candidate is an early career scientist in any scientific domain with a strong computational background, either in High Performance Computing or in Artificial Intelligence. They will just need a subset of the skills mentioned in the job description and be willing to learn more.
The primary role will be to support scientists running software on the Supercomputers Expanse and Voyager, but the position can also be funded by external grants to work on any scientific project, for example CMB-S4 Data Management.
> The position is hybrid, the candidate will need to be in the office at UCSD at least 1 day a week, and can work remotely the rest of the week.
> Members of historically under-represented communities are especially encouraged to apply.
> For any clarification, please [email Andrea Zonca](https://www.sdsc.edu/research/researcher_spotlight/zonca_andrea.html)
