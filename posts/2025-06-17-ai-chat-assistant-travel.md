Traveling often means unreliable or expensive internet access, especially on airplanes or in remote areas. Here are two practical ways to keep using AI chat assistants even when your connectivity is limited:

## 1. ChatGPT via WhatsApp or 1-800-ChatGPT During Flights

Many US airlines offer free in-flight "messaging" (iMessage, WhatsApp, etc.) but block regular web access. This means the ChatGPT app or website won't work, but you can still chat with ChatGPT using WhatsApp or by calling/texting 1-800-ChatGPT!

- There are services that connect ChatGPT to WhatsApp. As of June 2025, you can use the number provided by [ChatGPT for WhatsApp](https://www.chatgptforwhatsapp.com/) or similar services (search online for the latest number).
- Alternatively, you can call or text [1-800-ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10193193-1-800-chatgpt-calling-and-messaging-chatgpt-with-your-phone) to interact with ChatGPT using your phone's voice or SMS features.
- Add the number to your contacts, start a WhatsApp chat, or call/text 1-800-ChatGPT, and you can send/receive messages to ChatGPT using only the free messaging tier.
- This is a great way to get AI help, summaries, or even entertainment while flying, without paying for full internet access.

## 2. Run AI Models Directly on Your Phone

If you want an AI assistant that works even without any internet connection, you can run a model directly on your device:

- Google has released [Gemma 4B](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery), a small language model that can run entirely on modern smartphones.
- Download the model and a compatible app from the [Google AI Edge Gallery](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery).
- While Gemma 4B is not as accurate as cloud-based models (it can hallucinate or make mistakes), it is a powerful tool to have in your pocket when offline.

**Tip:** Always check the latest instructions and supported devices on the official GitHub page before installing.

With these two options, you can keep your AI assistant close at handâ€”whether you're in the air or off the grid!
