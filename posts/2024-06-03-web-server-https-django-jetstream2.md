title: Deploy a web server with automatic HTTPS for static website and Django app on Jestream 2

---

As part of my work to support the Jetstream 2 Openstack deployment at Indiana University, I have developed a tutorial that explains how to create a Virtual Machine that deploys the Caddy web server.

Caddy is extremely easy to use compared to Apache or NGINX.

In the tutorial I show both how to deploy some static pages and to deploy a toy application in Python Django.

See [the tutorial in the official Jetstream 2 documentation website](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/general/webserver/).
