title: New Simulations of the Panexp Model Suite for Planck and WMAP
---

Following up on my [recent post about PySM models for Galactic emission](./2025-03-03-paper-pysm-models.md), I have recently executed three new simulations of the Panexp model suite:

## New Simulations

* **Planck**: Using NPIPE beam window functions and PR3 bandpasses for HFI, Beyond Planck for LFI
* **WMAP**: Including bandpasses and beam window functions
* **Idealized delta-frequency instrument**: Features a 5 arcmin beam at all frequencies to be used for component separation studies (50 frequency channels spanning 20-800 GHz)

## Documentation and Access

Detailed documentation about these simulations can be found in the Simon Observatory's map-based simulations repository:
[Available Simulations Documentation](https://github.com/simonsobs/map_based_simulations/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#available-simulations)

As these are public datasets, they have also been published on the CMB-S4 data portal:
[CMB-S4 Data Portal](https://data.cmb-s4.org/)

These simulations provide valuable resources for researchers working on component separation and other CMB-related studies.
