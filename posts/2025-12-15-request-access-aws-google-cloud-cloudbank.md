title: Request Access to AWS and Google Cloud Resources via CloudBank for Scientists
---

CloudBank provides a simplified way for scientists and educators to access commercial cloud resources, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Access is free, but requires writing a proposal to justify the requested resources.

It is particularly useful for small-scale research production infrastructure and AI workloads.
