title: PEARC24 Paper Cheap and FAIR Data Portal
---

In this blog post, we summarize the key points from our recent paper presented at PEARC 2024, titled "Cheap and FAIR: A Serverless Research Data Repository for the Next Generation Cosmic Microwave Background Experiment."

## Introduction

The paper discusses the development and implementation of a cost-effective and equitable data portal designed to facilitate data sharing and collaboration among researchers involved in the CMB-S4 experiment. CMB-S4 is a large-scale scientific experiment jointly funded by NSF and DOE to measure radiation emitted just after the Big Bang.

## Key Features

- **Cost-Effective**: The portal leverages open-source technologies to minimize costs.
- **Equitable Access**: Ensures fair access to data for all researchers, regardless of their institutional affiliation or funding status.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a focus on ease of use to encourage widespread adoption.

## Implementation

The portal is built using a combination of modern web technologies and cloud infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability. Key components include:

- **Backend**: Powered by Globus for authentication, authorization, and data access.
- **Frontend**: A static web interface for browsing available datasets and their metadata.
- **Security**: Implements stringent security measures to protect sensitive data using Globus groups.

## Conclusion

The Cheap and FAIR Data Portal represents a significant step forward in democratizing access to research data. By reducing costs and ensuring equitable access, it aims to foster greater collaboration and innovation in the research community.
