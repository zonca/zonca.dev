Setup Kubernetes


Follow [the instructions on "Zero to Binderhub" to setup the Google Container Registry](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zero-to-binderhub/setup-registry.html#set-up-google-container-registry)
some notes:

* Better to create a dedicated project just for Binderhub
* "Create key" is under "Actions"->"Manage keys"
