title: Singularity Dask Zarr Container for Scientific Computing

---

This post introduces a Singularity container designed for scientific computing, leveraging Dask and Zarr for efficient data processing and storage. The container provides a reproducible environment for data-intensive tasks.

## Key Features:

*   **Efficient Data Processing:** Utilizes Dask for parallel and out-of-core computations.
*   **Scalable Data Storage:** Employs Zarr for chunked, compressed N-dimensional array storage.
*   **Reproducible Environments:** Singularity ensures consistent execution across different systems.

## Getting Started:

This container is built using Apptainer (formerly Singularity) via GitHub Actions, ensuring a streamlined and automated process. Python dependencies are managed through `requirements.txt`. The resulting container image is hosted on the GitHub Container Registry, allowing for easy pulling and deployment.

You can pull the container using:
```bash
singularity pull oras://ghcr.io/zonca/singularity_dask_zarr:latest
```
