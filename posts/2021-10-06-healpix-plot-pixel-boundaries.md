title: Plot HEALPix pixel boundaries
categories: [healpy]
---

Some time ago I created a Jupyter Notebook based on `plotly` to create a 3D visualization of the boundaries of HEALPix pixels on the sphere.

The notebook is available on Gist at <https://gist.github.com/zonca/b3045651cbc90fe699d2e56df490b005>.

See below the outputs ranging from Nside 1 to 8:
