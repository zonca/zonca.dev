title: Latest Maxima and WxMaxima for Ubuntu Karmic

---

**Note**: The original third-party repository for Maxima packages is no longer available.

On the maxima mailing lists they suggested to install the sbcl built, so I first installed sbcl from the Ubuntu repositories and then maxima and wxmaxima from the third-party repository.
