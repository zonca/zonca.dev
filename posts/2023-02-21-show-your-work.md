title: Showyourwork! Globus demo

---

[Showyourwork!](https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork) is a great project to make scientific articles reproducible.

I participated to its first Hack Day, I focused on building a simple recipe in SnakeMake (the workflow engine behind Showyourwork!) to interface with data stored on Globus.

[See the repository on Github](https://github.com/zonca/showyourwork_globus_demo/tree/main/snakemake_globus_demo)
