title: Learn Italian in San Diego
categories: [italian]

My wife Maura D'Andrea recently opened a new [Italian language school in San Diego](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/about/).

All instructors are mother-tongue Italian, they teach to kids and adults.

See the [available Italian in-person classes in San Diego](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/classes), they are split in 2 tracks, one for people looking to learn Italian, one for kids that have Italian heritage and want to follow the same program taught in Italy's public school system.

Classes are online and in-person in University City, San Diego.
