title: Export a Confluence page to Markdown
---

I feel the pain, you have a page trapped in Confluence and you want to set it free. Of course the "Export" features of Confluence are useless.

The trick is really easy:

* Select all the text in the Confluence page, no need to enter "Edit" mode, just select the entire page as it is in view mode.
* Paste it into "Google Docs", this is going to maintain titles, links, bold, italics, even escapes underscores, unfortunately won't be able to export images.
* In Google Docs, go to "File" -> "Download" -> "Markdown (.md)"
