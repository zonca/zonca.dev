My talk for the San Diego Data Science meetup: [http://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Data-Science-R-Users-Group/events/170967362/](http://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Data-Science-R-Users-Group/events/170967362/)

About:

* Setup [StarCluster](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/) to launch EC2 instances
* Running IPython Notebook on Amazon EC2
* Running single node Machine Learning jobs using multiple cores
* Distributing jobs with IPython parallel to multiple EC2 instances

* See HTML5 **slides**: [http://bit.ly/ml-ec2](http://bit.ly/ml-ec2)
* See the IPython notebook sources of the slides: [http://bit.ly/ml-ec2-ipynb](http://bit.ly/ml-ec2-ipynb)
