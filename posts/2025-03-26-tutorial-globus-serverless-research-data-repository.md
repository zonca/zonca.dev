title: Gateways 2024 - Tutorial on Creating a Serverless Research Data Repository based on Globus
slug: tutorial-globus-serverless-research-data-repository
---

Following our [work published at PEARC 2024 presenting a Data Portal based on a static website built on top of Globus HTTPS services](./2024-07-31-pearc-paper-cheapandfair-data-portal.md), we presented a tutorial at Gateways 2024.

## Tutorial Description

**Abstract**: In this tutorial, we will walk our attendees through the process of starting from data files in a folder, organizing them into a Globus collection, and then publishing a data catalog website to GitHub pages using the "Serverless Research Data Repository" (SRDR) tools. At each stage of the process, we will highlight the features required to make a published dataset compliant with the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse) principles. The tutorial is targeted both at gateway developers interested in deploying and administering their own data portal and at attendees interested in publishing their data in the most effective way.
