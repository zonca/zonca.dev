title: New Paper on Arxiv about Models of Galactic Emission in the Microwaves for CMB Experiments
---

A new paper has been published on Arxiv discussing models of Galactic emission in the microwaves for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments:

[New Paper on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20452)

The models are available publicly through the PySM3 (Python Sky Model) software package:

[PySM3 Documentation](https://pysm3.readthedocs.io/)

Moreover, the CMB-S4 data portal has simulations of the Galactic emission using PySM3 for several past, current and future CMB experiments, see:
