title: Updated Tutorial on The Littlest JupyterHub on Jetstream
---

I'm excited to share that I've contributed an updated tutorial on how to deploy "The Littlest JupyterHub" (TLJH) on a Jetstream instance!

TLJH is a simple way to set up a JupyterHub for a small group of users. It's designed to be easy to install and maintain, making it perfect for classrooms, workshops, or small research teams. Jetstream is a national science and engineering cloud environment that provides on-demand computing and data analysis resources.

This updated tutorial provides step-by-step instructions to get your own TLJH instance running on Jetstream, leveraging the power of cloud computing for interactive data science and research.

You can find the updated tutorial here: [https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/jetstream.html](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/jetstream.html)
