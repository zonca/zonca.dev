title: Running Nextflow on Expanse
---

This tutorial will guide you through setting up Nextflow on Expanse.

### 1. Install Micromamba

Expanse uses an older version of Anaconda, so we'll install Micromamba for a more up-to-date and isolated environment. Follow the official Micromamba installation guide: [https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html)

After installation, make sure to configure your `bash` shell. You will need to log out and log back in, or source your `~/.bashrc` file for the changes to take effect.
