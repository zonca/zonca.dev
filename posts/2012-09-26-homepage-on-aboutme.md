<p>
 moved my homepage to about.me:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <a href="http://about.me/andreazonca">
  http://about.me/andreazonca
 </a>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 it is quite nice, and essential, as most of it is just links to other websites, i.e. arXiv for publications, Linkedin for CV, github for code.
 <br/>
 So I'm going to use andreazonca.com as blog, hosted on blogger.
