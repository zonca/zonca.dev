title: News item on SDSC website about Advanced Simons Observatory and PySM

---

In collaboration with the SDSC Communications team I prepared a news item for the SDSC Website announcing my participation in the Advanced Simons Observatory project focusing on my work on supporting PySM.

See <https://www.sdsc.edu/News%20Items/PR20240503_Advanced_Simons_Observatory.html>

Notice that I have published the [notebook I used to generate the 6 images](./2024-04-12-pysm-figures.ipynb).
