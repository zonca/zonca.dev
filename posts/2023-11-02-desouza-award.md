title: Received DeSouza award for work on deploying software infrastructure on Jetstream 

---

I am honored to have received the 2023 DeSouza award from [Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/), a NSF-funded center providing data, software and support for the field of Geoscience.
The award celebrates the impact of Jeremy Fischer's and my work on deploying a software platform based on Kubernetes and JupyterHub (in particular [Zero to JupyterHub](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/)) on the NSF-funded cloud computing system Jetstream 2.
