title: Software Citation Station

This post introduces the "Software Citation Station" by Tom Wagg, a tool designed to help researchers generate accurate and comprehensive citations for software. It simplifies the process of giving credit to software used in academic work, ensuring proper attribution and reproducibility.

The tool allows users to input a software package (e.g., from PyPI, GitHub, or a DOI) and automatically generates citations in various formats. This is particularly useful for academic papers, theses, and other research outputs where proper software citation is crucial.

For example, to cite the `healpy` Python package, you can use the following link which pre-selects the package: `https://www.tomwagg.com/software-citation-station/?auto-select=healpy`
