title: "Automate GitHub PR Merging for Efficient Workflows"
---

GitHub's automerge feature streamlines development by automatically merging pull requests once all checks pass. This can significantly speed up your team's workflow, especially in projects with continuous integration and delivery.

### How to Enable Automerge

To enable automerge for a pull request:

1.  **Ensure all required checks are passing:** This includes CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, and any other branch protection rules.
2.  **Click the "Enable auto-merge" option:** This button appears on the pull request page once all conditions are met.

Once enabled, GitHub will automatically merge the PR when it's ready, freeing you from manual monitoring. This is particularly useful for small, self-contained changes or when you're confident in your automated testing.
