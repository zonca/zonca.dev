# Agent notes

- When adding links between posts in `posts/`, use Hugo/Quarto relref with just the filename because all posts live in the same folder: `{{< relref "2025-12-01-custom-jupyterhub-docker-image.md" >}}`. Do not prefix with `posts/`, or the link will break.  
- Review GEMINI.md before working—contains project-specific guidance and expectations.
